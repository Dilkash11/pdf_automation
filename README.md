# Pdf_automation
In my automation project, I've implemented a sophisticated system for extracting tables from PDFs using a keyword search. The extracted data is intelligently consolidated into a master table, conveniently stored in an Excel file named "Master_file." Additionally, the automation generates two vital output files: "Filename_list" meticulously records the filenames for successful extractions, while "File_error" captures filenames encountering exceptions.

To enhance efficiency, the automation intelligently checks the "Filename_list" file during subsequent runs. It selectively processes files listed therein, ensuring a streamlined workflow. After successful extraction, the updated data seamlessly integrates into "Master_file," "Filename_list," and "File_error," maintaining an organized and evolving database.
